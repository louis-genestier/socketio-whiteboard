# socketio-whiteboard

DEMO: https://whiteboardsocketio.herokuapp.com/
My first project using socket.io, a collaborative whiteboard.  
You can select your color and reset the whiteboard.

## Installation

Install the dependencies: `npm i`
You need to set the environnement variable `PORT` to run the server.
